# AED Problem #2

##  Getting Started
These instructions will help to compile and run developed programs on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
To compile programs, it is necessary to have a C compiler installed on your local machine, for example cc. 

### Compiling
The following command **compiles main program** (*main.c*) where <executable_filename>  will be the executable filename: 

```
cc -Wall -O2 main.c -o <executable_filename> -lm
```

## Running

**Options:**
```
-l ........................ Initialize program using HashTable with Linked Lists
    
-b ........................ Initialize program using HashTable with Ordered Binary Trees
    
-t ........................ Initialize program and runs some tests
```
## Details
All the details, including the results, can be found in the [Work Report](/relatorio/AED_Report_2.pdf).
